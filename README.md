# ProtestDetection

A Convolutional Neural Network that uses Transfer Learning using Resnet - 50 to do image classification.
Given an image, the model is able to give a binary yes/no for whether the input image has the following features:
“Protest”, “Signs”, “Photos”, “Fire”, “Police”, “Children”, “Flag”, “Night”, “Shouting”.
It can also give a probabilistic prediction for the Degree of Violence in the image.
